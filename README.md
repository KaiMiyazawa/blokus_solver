## Our team's Strategy  
We thought that under the Blockus game rules, a strategy that reduces the number of places where the opponent can place the next block would be strong because it would lead to blocking the opponent's action.  

Thus, we began to develop in the derection of "sticy strategy".  

The specific process is as follows.  
1. List up the moves that are not foul. -> strage as "ok_cases" list.
2. Leave good moves from the "sticy strategy" in "ok_cases"
3. Leave bigger block's moves in "ok_cases"
4. and so on ...
